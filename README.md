## 📁 How It Works

1. **Upload PDF** from the client app  
2. Client sends the file to the server  
3. Server processes the file using Python:  
   - Extracts text using PDF parsing  
   - Sends it to Gemini AI to generate quiz content  
4. AI responds with a JSON → converted to CSV  
5. CSV sent back to client and displayed in quiz UI  
6. User completes quiz → client calculates score  
7. Score sent to server → Genie image (happy/sad) is sent back for visual feedback
